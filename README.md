- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I am Ruixuan Zhang. I am a post-doctoral researcher in Hiroyuki Ogata's lab in Kyoto University, Japan.

- ðŸ”­ I am interested in genome evolution. I view the genome representing the fitness to current environment, recording past evolutionary events, and constraining the path of evolution in the future. I want to understand the evolutionary rule by integrating wet lab experiments and bioinformatic tools.
